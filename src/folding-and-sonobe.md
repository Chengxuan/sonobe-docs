# Folding schemes and Sonobe

## Folding schemes overview

Folding schemes are a family of SNARKs for iterative computations, allowing to prove that a function $F$ applied $n$ times to an initial input $z_0$ results in $z_n$.

Where $w_i$ are the external witnesses used at each iterative step.

In other words, it allows to prove efficiently that $z_n = F(...~F(F(F(F(z_0, w_0), w_1), w_2), ...), w_{n-1})$.

## Sonobe overview

Sonobe is a folding schemes modular library to fold R1CS instances in an Incremental Verifiable computation (IVC) style. It also provides the tools required to generate a zkSNARK out of an IVC proof and to verify it on Ethereum's EVM.

The development flow using Sonobe looks like:

1. Define a circuit to be folded
2. Set which folding scheme to be used (eg. Nova)
3. Set a final decider to generate the final proof (eg. Spartan over Pasta curves)
4. Generate the the decider verifier

The folding scheme and decider used can be swapped respectively with a few lines of code (eg. switching from a Decider that uses two Spartan proofs over a cycle of curves, to a Decider that uses a single Groth16 proof over the BN254 to be verified in an Ethereum smart contract).
